        "- Understand conversational memory in LangChain\n",
        "- Compare memory types: Buffer vs Summary\n",
        "- Master LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) composition\n",
        "- Build streaming, retry, and fallback patterns\n",

        "**What we'll cover:**\n",
        "1. **Section A: Memory 101** - Buffer and Summary memory patterns\n",
        "2. **Section B: Memory in Chains** - Inject memory into conversational flows\n",
        "3. **Section C: LCEL Basics** - Compose runnables with `|` operator\n",
        "4. **Section D: Advanced LCEL** - Streaming, retry, fallbacks\n",

        "**Prerequisites:** Notebooks 01 & 02 completed\n",
